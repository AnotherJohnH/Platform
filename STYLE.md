# Style Preferences

- Only function arguments use trailing underscores e.g.`frequency_hz_`
- Class names use PascalCase e.g. `Tuner`
- Method and function names use lowerCamelCase e.g. `setSampleRate`
- Prefer calling `printf` and `fprintf` without qualifying them with `std::`
- Prefer the type keyword `signed` rather than `int` when an explicit signed type is needed
- Three space indent
